# Advanced Control Systems

Exploration of robot dynamics and control architectures. The project was developed during the course Advanced Control Systems at University of Verona and it contains a full analysis of an assigned 3DOF robot (RPP):

- Kinematics (Direct, Inverse, Differential)
- Dynamics (Lagrangian, RNE formulations)

The following control architectures are implemented in Matlab Simulink:

- Joint Space PD with gravity compensation
- Joint Space Inverse Dynamics
- Operational Space PD with gravity compensation
- Operational Space Inverse Dynamics
- Compliance Control
- Impedance Control
- Admittance Control
- Force with inner position loop
- Parallel Force control
- Adaptive Control (for a 1 DOF link for simplicity)

A minimal report is provided in [docs](./doc/report.pdf)
